## Description

The AirBnB Clone project aims to emulate a simplified version of the AirBnB web application. This project includes the following features:

- A custom command interpreter that allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve various objects.
- Storage of data using JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Models for Users, Places, States, Cities, and Reviews, each with various attributes.
- Unittests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the models and the command interpreter.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter provides a way to manage your AirBnB objects through a command-line interface. Below are instructions on how to start and use the command interpreter.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

./console.py

### How to Use

- create <class name>: Creates a new instance of the specified class.
- show <class name> <id>: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
- destroy <class name> <id>: Deletes an instance based on the class name and id.
- all [class name]: Prints all string representations of all instances, or all instances of a specific class.
- update <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>": Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating an attribute.
